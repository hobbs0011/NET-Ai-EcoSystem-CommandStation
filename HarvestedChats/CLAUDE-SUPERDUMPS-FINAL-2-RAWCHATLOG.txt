I've loaded the Master Brain framework! I can see this is a comprehensive system for creating NET (Natural English Training) class note reviews with bilingual English/Vietnamese content, focusing on methods like Jolly Phonics, Buddy System, and comprehensible input.

Before I proceed, let me conduct the pre-survey to understand your specific needs:

Pre-Survey Questions
Content Scope: Which sections do you want to cover? Any specific vocabulary topics or NET methods to emphasize (e.g., Jolly Phonics for 's' sounds, conversational practice)?
Interactivity: What interactive features do you need?
INTERACT_RECORDING (pronunciation practice with audio recording)?
INTERACT_QUIZ (vocabulary/comprehension quizzes)?
Other interactive elements?
Design: Should I use the default Class Blue Theme (
#3B82F6 blue, 
#C0C0C0 silver) and include the NET logo?
Media: Do you have any specific YouTube URLs, images, or other media to embed for "fun learning"?
Layout: Which layout should I use?
Class_Note_Review (Medium - for B1+B2 review sessions)
Business_English_Curriculum (Large - comprehensive curriculum)
Delivery Format: HTML artifact (interactive, viewable here) or would you need PDF/LaTeX later?
GLOSSARY_CONCEPTS_METHODS: Which NET methods should I prioritize? (e.g., Learn Like Native, Jolly Phonics, Buddy System, Fun Learning)
Confirmation: Understood that this will be a single-file output with auto-updates per our conversation?
Please share any specific content you want me to review (vocabulary lists, lesson notes, topics) or let me know if you'd like me to create a sample B1+B2 class note review to demonstrate the system!

yes create the sample, but make this lesson but make it good
