The highest-priority security issues to address first in the NET SYSTEM V3.1 are:

1. **Governance Control Concentration Risk**  
   Mitigate risks from Apex II’s elevated operational authority by implementing multi-party consensus, digital enforcement of mandatory sequences, and strict audit logging to prevent rogue or unauthorized actions.

2. **Local Ephemeral Key System Security**  
   Harden local cryptographic key lifecycle management by integrating hardware-backed key storage (HSM), automating key rotation with multi-factor approvals, and continuously patching crypto libraries against vulnerabilities.

3. **Telemetry Spooling and Data Loss**  
   Prevent telemetry data loss and client-side storage overflow by supplementing IndexedDB spooling with encrypted fallback storage, enforcing backpressure controls, and deploying real-time telemetry volume monitoring and alerting.

4. **Legacy Token Scanner Reliability**  
   Protect against denial-of-service and missed legacy key detections from pathological or malformed payloads by optimizing key scans with timeout guards, chunked parallel processing, and comprehensive fuzz testing.

5. **Distributed Cluster State Consistency**  
   Avoid version drift across GPT/GROK/PERPLEXITY clusters via a centralized version registry, cluster-wide synchronization checkpoints, state reconciliation protocols, and enforced immutable payload hashing.

6. **Runtime Event and Timing Lock Robustness**  
   Prevent event hijacking and timing bypass by implementing multiple redundant DOM readiness checks, signed “ready” tokens, and active event sequence monitoring.

7. **Import Validation Atomicity & Rollback Completeness**  
   Ensure that import validation failures lead to full atomic rollback of state and side effects, verified with synthetic fault injection tests to prevent partial corruption.

8. **Explicit Failover and Quarantine Procedures**  
   Define and automate failover, rollback, and agent quarantine workflows to quickly isolate and recover from partial failures or compromised nodes.

Addressing these issues first will close critical operational and security gaps that have historically generated risk, and form the foundation necessary for a secure and resilient production-grade system.
